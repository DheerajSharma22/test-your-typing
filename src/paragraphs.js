        `JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others. It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async call. In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be done, basically here logical computation requires. Her main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser. With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React are helpful in this department. JavaScript can also be used to build an application for non-web contexts. The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications. This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different systems. Write once use it anywhere! JavaScript does not provide the same level of performance as offered by many traditional languages as a complex program written in JavaScript would be comparatively slow. But as JavaScript is used to perform simple tasks in a browser, so performance is not considered a big restriction in its use.`,

        `In the first stanza of the Bangle Sellers Summary, the narrator describes that the bangle sellers are shouting as they are trying to sell their bangles in the temple fair. The speaker compares the bangles as the "lustrous tokens of radiant lives". The speaker thinks that these bangles can bring happiness to their daughters and wives life. In the second stanza, the bangle sellers say that they carry various kinds of bangle for different types of women with different types of need. The speaker says there are bangles for young girls and they are silver and blue in colour. He compares the silver and blue colours to the mountain mist which represents the freshness in youth girls. Some bangles are red and pink in colour and they are compared to tender flower buds. The "buds that dreams" represents the dreaming for marriage and the green bangles represent the freshness of young women. This stanza describes the early stage of a woman's life. In the third stanza, she speaks about the yellow bangles that look like a field of sunlit corn. Field of sunlit corn this phrase describes the looks of the bride in the day of her wedding. She needs to look brighter of all on her wedding day. The bangle sellers also have some red and orange coloured bangles which represent the desire and wishes of the newly married bride. Here the bridal laughter means the happiness of starting a new life and the bridal tear means the pain of separation from her parents. This describes the transition of life from a young girl to wife.In the last stanza, the speaker describes the life of a woman after marriage. The bangle sellers are selling some purple bangles with gold and grey flecks. This colour describes the life of a woman who has journeyed through life and raised her children well, help her husband in all good and bad phase of their life.

He compares the silver and blue colours to the mountain mist which represents the freshness in youth girls. Some bangles are red and pink in colour and they are compared to tender flower buds. The "buds that dreams" represents the dreaming for marriage and the green bangles represent the freshness of young women.

        `Then, he shares his experience where he has seen many children watching television with eyes wide open and full concentration. They do not care even on getting too tired of watching. They keep on watching television until their eyes pop out. Moreover, they become still for long hours. They even forget the real world. The one happening on the television becomes real for them.

        Thus, they are almost captivated by this idiotic box.They are 'drunk', their minds are filled with those 'shocking ghastly junk' which are mostly artificial and unsuitable for the generation.Those TV shows kill their valuable time making them lazy too.They don't find time for their physical play and exercise.Moreover, they find no time for books and nature, and to interact with others.

        The poet says that television keeps the naughty children quiet as they don't climb out the window sill, fight, kick or punch, and let mother free to cook food and wash the dishes.However, he adds, it cannot be a defence and let them sit in front of a TV.He understands that it does more damage than good.

        Furthermore, the poet asks the parents if they exactly understand what are they doing with their lovely child.He answers the question himself.He tells that television damage their senses.A child becomes unaware of the real world.He takes whatever it shows as real.It kills his imagination power and creativity.A child views different shows with contradictory ideas.This, they get messed up in their thoughts.

        Moreover, he is unable to utilise his time in thinking over other things as he is already messed up with the thoughts of the fictional world.He could not make efforts for the development of his personality thus making him dull and blind.Also, children fail to understand a fairy tale as they are captured by virtual reality.Also, their brain becomes soft as cheese.They could not think on their own.Their thought process freezes and gets rusty.

        Now, he answers the question that parents would ask him as to how to keep their children engaged in the absence of TV.He answers that they should be motivated to read and read and read.He adds that children in earlier times used to read a lot.The nursery shelves were full of books.Also, books were scattered everywhere.Moreover, the poet talks about popular books on the adventure of his time.These included books of dragons, gipsies, Queens and many others.Also, the youth in earlier times used to read stories written by Helen Beatrix Potter.Some of his stories like 'How the Camel got its hump' and its characters are also mentioned.

        The poet, thus, requests the parents to throw away the television set and install a bookshelf in its place.However, the children would resist the change by giving dirty looks, yelling, screaming or biting, yet, they should be overlooked.

        The poet says that the children will have no option left but to read books in the absence of television.Then, slowly they would start finding joy and would even thank their parents in the future to fill them with knowledge and wisdom.`
